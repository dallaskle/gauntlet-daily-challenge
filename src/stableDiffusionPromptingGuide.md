# Stable Diffusion 3.5 Prompt Guide

## Structuring your prompt

Treat the SD3.5 models as a creative partner. By expressing your ideas clearly in natural language, you give the model the best opportunity to generate an image that aligns with your vision.

To structure a prompt effectively, start by identifying the key elements:

### Style
- **Define the aesthetic direction:** Specify illustration style, painting medium, digital art style, or photography.
- **Experiment and blend styles:** Examples include line art, watercolor, oil painting, surrealism, expressionism, and product photography.
- **Examples:**  
  - "Expressionist painting"  
  - "Black and white, line art"  
  - "Isometric voxel art"

### Subject and Action
- **Focus on the subject:** If your image has a subject, amplify its presence first, followed by any actions the subject takes.
- **Examples:**  
  - "Low-angle side shot of a cute robot"  
  - "Wide shot of an elderly couple holding hands"  
  - "Wide shot of a doctor"

### Composition and Framing
- **Describe the composition:** Specify whether you want close-up shots or wide-angle views to frame the image.

### Lighting and Color
- **Describe the lighting or shadows:** Use terms like "backlight", "hard rim light", and "dynamic shadows" to set the mood.

### Technical Parameters
- **Specify cinematic terms:** Guide the perspective and framing using terms such as:
  - "Bird’s eye view"
  - "Close-up"
  - "Crane shot"
  - "Wide-angle shot"
- **Consider unique effects:** Use terms like "fish-eye lens" for a curved look and to achieve unique visual effects.

### Text
- **Incorporate text into images:**  
  - Enclose desired words or phrases in “double quotes.”
  - Keep the text short for optimal results.

### Negative Prompting
- **Control unwanted elements:**  
  - Negative prompting allows precise control over colors and content.
  - It refines the image by filtering out unwanted elements, textures, or hues.
- **Benefit:** This technique minimizes distractions and ensures that the final output aligns closely with your intended vision.

By following these practices—defining subjects, actions, lighting, composition, etc.—you can achieve the best results from each model. Keeping these best practices in mind makes the creative process using SD3.5 models more efficient.
