Design Specification
Header/Title Section
Title: “Image Generation Challenge”
Description: A brief set of instructions, for example:
"Enter a description below to generate an image using Stable Diffusion. You have 3 attempts per session."
Display Area
Image Placeholder:
A bordered box at the top of the page.
This area will display the generated image.
(Optionally, a carousel or gallery can be used if you plan to show previous generations.)
Input Section
Prompt Input Field:
A text input with placeholder text such as “Enter a description for the image…”
Tries Indicator:
A counter showing the number of attempts left (starting at 3) positioned near the prompt field.
Action Button
Submit Button:
A clear button labeled “Submit” or “Generate Image.”
On click, the user’s prompt is sent to the backend (powered by Stable Diffusion) to generate an image.
Output Section
Image Display:
Once generated, the image appears in the image placeholder.
Retry Option:
If attempts remain, the user can modify their prompt and try again.
Feedback/Instructions:
A note below the image or prompt field reminding users of the 3-try limit.
Additional information may include, “Your generated image will appear above. You have 3 attempts per session.”
User Flow
The user enters a prompt in the text field.
The user clicks the “Submit” button.
The system sends the prompt to the Stable Diffusion backend.
The generated image is returned and displayed in the Image Placeholder.
The tries counter is decremented by one.
If attempts remain, the user can modify the prompt and submit again.

How It Works
Frontend:
You can create a user-friendly interface in Next.js that contains your input field, image display area, and a tries counter. The page can be built with React components, and you can style it using CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

Backend/API Routes:
Next.js allows you to set up API routes (files in the pages/api directory) that can serve as serverless functions. In these routes, you can send HTTP requests to the Stability AI API to generate an image based on the user’s text prompt. Once you receive the generated image URL or data from Stability AI, you can pass that back to the frontend for display.

Integration with Stability AI:
Stability AI provides APIs for image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion). You can call these APIs directly from your Next.js API routes. Tutorials and repositories—such as those demonstrating how to build AI image generators using Next.js—show exactly how to integrate these services. For instance, you can refer to resources like the GitHub project lablab-ai/stable-diffusion-vercel-nextjs or various Medium tutorials (see 
MEDIUM.COM
 and 
LABLAB.AI
) for detailed implementation examples.

What to Consider
API Keys & Security:
Make sure you securely store your API keys (e.g., in environment variables) and call the Stability AI endpoints from your backend code to prevent exposing sensitive credentials on the client side.

Error Handling & Limits:
Implement proper error handling, especially since you’re enforcing a 3-try limit per session. You can maintain state on the frontend (or even the backend via sessions) to track how many attempts the user has made.

Deployment:
With Next.js, you can deploy your application on platforms like Vercel, which seamlessly supports Next.js projects. This deployment approach also supports serverless functions, making it a great fit for your API routes.

Conclusion
In summary, building your Image Generation Challenge in Next.js with Stability AI is not only possible—it’s an excellent stack choice. The flexibility of Next.js for both frontend and backend tasks, combined with the powerful image generation capabilities of Stable Diffusion via Stability AI, makes for a great learning and prototyping platform.

Example Usage in Next.js API Route
Here's an example of how you might integrate the snippet in a Next.js API route:

js
Copy
// pages/api/generateImage.js
import fs from "node:fs";
import axios from "axios";
import FormData from "form-data";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== "POST") {
    res.status(405).json({ error: "Method Not Allowed" });
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    const payload = {
      prompt: "Lighthouse on a cliff overlooking the ocean",
      output_format: "jpeg",
    };

    const response = await axios.postForm(
      `https://api.stability.ai/v2beta/stable-image/generate/sd3`,
      axios.toFormData(payload, new FormData()),
      {
        validateStatus: undefined,
        responseType: "arraybuffer",
        headers: { 
          Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.STABILITY_API_KEY}`, 
          Accept: "image/*" 
        },
      }
    );

    if (response.status === 200) {
      // Optionally, write to file system (server-side only)
      fs.writeFileSync("./lighthouse.jpeg", Buffer.from(response.data));
      res.status(200).send("Image generated and saved.");
    } else {
      throw new Error(`${response.status}: ${response.data.toString()}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
}
In this example, the code is placed in an API route where it runs securely on the server. Remember not to expose any sensitive keys or perform file system operations on the client side.

This setup leverages Next.js's server-side capabilities, allowing you to use Stability AI's API seamlessly within your application.
