Webpage Design: Image Generation Challenge

Overview:
This page is dedicated to the image generation challenge. The user will input a prompt, and the system (powered by Stable Diffusion) will generate an image in response. The user is allowed up to 3 attempts.

Layout & Components:

Header/Title Section:

A clear title at the top (e.g., “Image Generation Challenge”).
A short description or instructions about the challenge.
Display Area:

Image Placeholder:
At the top of the page, reserve an area where the generated image will appear.
Example: A bordered box or a dynamic carousel if you plan to show previous generations.
Input Section:

Prompt Input Field:
A text input where users can type their image description.
Example: “Enter a description for the image…”
Tries Indicator:
Display the number of tries remaining (starting at 3). This can be shown as a counter next to or below the input field.
Action Button:

Submit Button:
A clearly visible button labeled “Submit” or “Generate Image”.
On click, it sends the prompt to the backend, which uses Stable Diffusion to generate an image.
Output Section:

Once the image is generated, it appears in the Image Placeholder.
Optionally, provide a “Try Again” option if the user hasn’t exhausted their 3 attempts.
Feedback/Instructions:

A brief note below the image or the prompt field explaining the 3-try limit.
Information about using the generated images (e.g., “Your generated image will appear above. You have 3 attempts per session.”)
User Flow:

The user enters their prompt into the input field.
The user clicks the “Submit” button.
The system sends the prompt to the Stable Diffusion backend.
The generated image is returned and displayed in the Image Placeholder.
The tries counter decreases by one; if attempts remain, the user may modify their prompt and submit again.
Pre-Lesson Context:
This page is designed as a hands-on introduction to image generation using Stable Diffusion. It allows users to see immediate results from their text prompts, fostering engagement and serving as a pre-lesson demonstration for tomorrow’s session.

This layout offers a clear, intuitive interface that guides users through the image generation process while enforcing the 3-try limit. It is designed to be simple and engaging for a pre-lesson demonstration.
